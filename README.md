# Rodney the Radical Robit
FRC Robot Code 2019
Code being used for the robotics competition in 2019. 
Imagine making a Github page for robotics but it doesn't even matter. Some kid in a year will just steal the code anyway, and that's what I really work for, isn't it?

v1.1 Alpha (*x*)

Finished/No Further Changes--
lol none 

Currently Finished/May Need Tweaking--
Ground movement. 
Intake System. 

To Do List--
Elevator Manual Mode. 
Add ultrasonic sensors. 
Assign the proper motor IDS to their respective motor. 

Abandoned because I spent time on it and people had better ideas after I already made it--
Elevator Semi-automatic.


Obligatory Robots quote:

Fender: You consider me a friend?

Rodney Copperbottom: Sure. What else would I consider you?

Fender: I don't know. An embarrassment? A way to rebel against your parents? A desperate cry for help? The list is endless.
