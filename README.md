Patricia, since I know you are going to be busy working on cutting the metal and other stuff, I can probably implement the code
for the ultrasonic sensor. Since you are the electrical lead, I need you to assign the proper motor IDs, thanks.

Obligatory Robots quote:

Fender: You consider me a friend?

Rodney Copperbottom: Sure. What else would I consider you?

Fender: I don't know. An embarrassment? A way to rebel against your parents? A desperate cry for help? The list is endless.
